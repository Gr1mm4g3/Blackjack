# Blackjack Training Game Roadmap

## Project Overview
An interactive Blackjack game that teaches players perfect Basic Strategy through visual gameplay and real-time feedback. The game will simulate a real casino experience while providing educational guidance to help players make optimal decisions.

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **Next.js** - React framework for building the user interface
- **TailwindCSS** - For styling and responsive design
- **React DnD** (optional) - For drag-and-drop card interactions
- **Canvas/SVG** - For card animations and visual effects

### Backend
- **Node.js** - Runtime environment
- **TypeScript** - For type safety and better development experience
- **Jest** - For unit testing
- **ESLint/Prettier** - Code formatting and linting

### State Management
- **React Context API** - For global state management
- **Local Storage** - For persisting game statistics and user preferences
